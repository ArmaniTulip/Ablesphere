# AdaptAI
Adaptive AI Assistant - Learning Algorithm Prototype Utilizing ESP 32 Module

Our goal is to develop a prototype of an AI system that employs adaptive learning algorithms to analyze and adapt to user behaviors, offering personalized assistance to individuals with disabilities. This system, powered by an ESP 32 Module, connects seamlessly to both the user’s laptop and smartphone, syncing data across devices for consistent service adjustments. By utilizing prompt verification mechanisms, the system ensures that all commands and interactions are specifically tailored to suit the accessibility needs of users based on their disabilities. This feature not only enhances user safety and interaction quality but also improves daily productivity and independence by adjusting application interfaces and accessibility settings in real-time according to the user’s context and specific needs.
