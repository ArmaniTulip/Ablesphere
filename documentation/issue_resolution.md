# Issue Resolution: adaptive_logic.py

## Investigation Summary

Upon investigation, it was determined that `adaptive_logic.py` is not a part of the C#/.NET project. This file appears to be mistakenly referenced, as the project is exclusively using C# and .NET technologies, and Python files are not relevant in this context.

## Resolution Steps

1. **Confirmation**: Verified that `adaptive_logic.py` does not exist in the repository.
2. **Assumptions**: Assumed that the reference to `adaptive_logic.py` was an error or miscommunication.
3. **Documentation**: Created this document to record the investigation process and findings.

## Conclusion

No changes were made to the repository as `adaptive_logic.py` is not applicable to the current project setup.
